2.need rows and colums --> going to need 
3. input forms on j query for user input
------>what is the best way to handle this? standard form input? use prevent default to keep from disappearing once reloaded?

onclick > becomes form > click save button > store to local > output to div for record

these input forms need to be able to be manipulated by jquery for date and time functions


4. Store these inputs in localstorage only if user hits save button
button from bootstrap?

if save button clicked, run function savehour
function savehour(){
    window.localStorage.setItem('clicks',form input);
preventdefault()


5. date and time function needs to operate in jumbotron at top
moment().format("MMM Do YY");     

6. we have to work with the css parameters we are provided. some of them are defined for us, without being in the html
7. Each "timeblock" needs to be divided into three parts
	time of day
	user input
	save button -->> write to localstorage
8. the preprovided css gives us hints as to how to structure our calander

9.If hour < currenthour
 then make form input inaccessible
background = gray

If hour > currenthour
 then make form input accessible
background = green

If hour === currenthour
 then display "current hour" in form box
background = red
